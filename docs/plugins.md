# Plugins
Tasks that are not considered "core" functionality in PyMind are implemented as plugins, they just happened to be
bundled in the project source. They cannot currently be disabled, but eventually the goal is to be able to enable and
disable external and internal plugins individually.

Below are a list of the built-in plugins:

- [footer]()
- [navigation bar generator]()
- [title]()
- [landing page generator]()
- [referenced in]()
- [tags page generator]()
