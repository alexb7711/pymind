# Navigation Bar
The navigation bar generator, as the name implies, dynamically generates a navigation bar based on files labeled with
the `<!-- :nav: --> ` tag. The `index.md` file will be added by default, even if the `nav` tag was not included. The
navigation bar is injected using a `<div id="navigation">` tag.
